## Usage

```ts
import '@internetarchive/collection-browser';

</collection-browser>
```

## Local Demo with `web-dev-server`

## Testing with Web Test Runner
To run the suite of Web Test Runner tests, run

```

```bash
yarn run test:watch
```

## Linting with ESLint, Prettier, and Types
To scan the project for linting errors, run
```bash
yarn run lint
```

You can lint with ESLint and Prettier individually as well
```bash
yarn run lint:eslint
```
```bash
yarn run lint:prettier
```

To automatically fix many linting errors, run
```bash
yarn run format
```

You can format using ESLint and Prettier individually as well
```bash
yarn run format:eslint
```
```bash
yarn run format:prettier
```

## Tooling configs

For most of the tools, the configuration is in the `package.json` to reduce the amount of files in your project.

If you customize the configuration a lot, you can consider moving them to individual files.

## Manual Deploy using `gh-pages`

Review app base URL: [https://internetarchive.github.io/iaux-collection-browser](https://internetarchive.github.io/iaux-collection-browser)

```
yarn run deploy -e <review_app_name>
```

**NOTE:** :exclamation:  This is very important

- if you just run only the command: `yarn run deploy` or `yarn deploy` without the `-e` parameter, it will delete all the files in `gh-pages` branch and replace it with the new changes you just deployed
